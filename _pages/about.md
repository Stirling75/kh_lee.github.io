I am a Ph.D Student at **Korea University**, focusing on **Homomorphic Encryption** and related cryptographic technologies. 
My current research interests include:
- **Homomorphic Encryption** : Specifically, I'm interestesd in TFHE/FHEW-based homomorphic encryption schemes, and improving them. 
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques** : Improving privacy in real-world using homomorphic encryption. 

In the future, I plan to research on 
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)**
- **Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**
